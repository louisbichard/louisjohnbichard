            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> The internet has brought about profound changes in the way we live. Technical innovations are creating products for problems we didn’t even know we had. Any idea that can be converted into technology already is and new and profitable ideas are now only generated by those with a deep understanding of user problems; smart creatives as Google likes to call these people. </p>
            <p>Speed to market and speed to test product hypothesises means that products are competing more ferociously and in order to differentiate businesses need to validate their ideas quicker to bring more valuable products to market.</p>
            <p>New technologies are constantly evolving, meaning that for software engineers the volume of technical “options” is very hard to keep on-top of. To be effective technical decision makers and influencers of these decisions have to be able to understand what is the correct tool for the job. But with so many tools, it can be hard to make these decisions in an informed manner. </p>

            <h3>The solution</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I believe taking responsibility for the full end to end process is what helps to create good software (cross-functionality as scrum would define it). Extending the responsibility of the software engineer to include business awareness on topics such as: product KPI’s, user adoption, revenue model etc gives more meaning to the software being created. </p>
            <p>The engineer understands the user and can deliver technical solutions, not just the product owner, not just the public facing sales team, but the software engineers themselves. Software engineers who balance both technical and business understanding are the most desirable in markets creating new and innovative products. Software engineers then understand not only what can be done, but what should be done. </p>

                    <p class="text-center"> I will achieve this by continually pushing myself to keep up with the latest technologies, and by ensuring that I have a working knowledge in as many domains as possible.</p>
