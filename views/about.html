        <p> Firstly, thankyou for taking the time out to visit my portfolio! </p>
        <p> My name is Louis John Bichard and I am a full stack web developer &amp; currently a finalist Information Management &amp; Computing student at Loughborough University. </p>
        <p> I have a passion for Javascript, both on the server and the client. Due to Javascripts very unrestricting nature it allows for incredibly fluent, readbale and enjoyable code to write. I am also very aware that this flexibily loose-typed nature makes it a tough beast to tame and over time have come to be a great advocate of testing. </p>

                <p> When I was 16 I got the first taste of weight training when I started training at a local hotel where I worked with my brother. Over the next couple of years he was training for his entry to the military and I would train with him for the fun and to help out with strength for Rugby. Soon we got very competitive and were challenging and stretching each other. Before I knew it I was addicted. </p>

                <p> Weight training soon became a lot more to me than just a training tool to further my strength in rugby. I started to get my head around nutrition and realise its powers that were far greater than the psyiological response. The empowerment that you get with having full control over your energy levels, physique and body type was almost overwhelming. </p>

                <p> As time went on I started pursuing other avenues to keep my interest in weightlifting up and soon found Powerlifting. I begun competing competitively in 2013 as a Junior in the Great British Powerlifting Federation up to national level. </p>

                <p> Out of curiosity and the exposure to excellent coaching in Loughborough, weightlifting has now been added to my weight training regimine and I look to not only compete but also take to nationals in late 2015.</p>

                <p> Weight training taught me almost all of the personal traits that I exume today and is a large source of motivation for my blog posts. </p>
