#The Brogrammer: Nutrient Timing
##What is nutrient timing and why should I care?

Nutrient timing is the usage of your eating habits as a tool to leverage and harness your own physical but mental potential. Your physique and strength is but a manifestation of your mental state, and by using nutrient timing to access your mental talents, you can affect not only your physical state but also assist in your career.

###Why everyone and not just programmers should care about nutrients

Nutrient timing is not just for athletes, by gaining 100% control over your physiology you can improve your potential, this is especially important in such a mentally demanding role as developing. Read on to find out some of the diet related tools I use to maximise my own personal efficiency.

##Nutrient timing strategies

###Short term starvation
####Disclaimer
I am NOT condoning long term starvation of any kind, but only as a short term tool for enhanced cognition. I do condone eating in each day your required nutrients (micro and macro) however I am advocating eating these at any time so you can maximise your energy levels.

####Overview
This may seem like a peculiar aspect to mention but is probably one of THE most powerful tools that I use to harness my own potential. When you are depleted of food for a short period of time, the body will upregulate into a mode where it knows that it needs food. It’s fight or flight, and the body WILL fight, you will be coniderably more alert when depleted slightly as the body believes that it needs to be alert to hunt and scavenge for more food to survive. When satieted the body can often turn off.

####Striking the balance
There is a very careful balance that you must achieve here in order to really gain the potential. If you are too hungry, your mental focus will be shifted to concentrating on the feelings of pain and this will damage the point completely, if you are very conscious of your hunger you have simply gone too far.

This works as a great caveat in leading onto my next strategy.

##Backloading like a Warrior
###What is backloading?

Backloading is typically used in the fitness industry to regard carbohydrate backloading, a method whereby all of your daily carbohydrates are consumed at the end of the day. However I am just referred to backloading all remaining calories to the end of the day when all work is complete and the body needs replenishing for the coming day which is commonly referred to as the warrior diet. The name is irrelevant, what is relevant is the results.

###How to use backloading

If you are to follow a strategy whereby you incorporate short term starvation into your day, you must ensure that you get your total nutrients for the day. After many years of tracking my macronutrient intakes, I know roughly the amount of carbohydrates, fats and protein that I need to eat in a day to ensure that I am the correct weight for my weightlifting class. As it does not matter for body composition at all when you eat these meals, I find it most efficient to push all of these meals to one large meal at the end of the day. This is usually when I make a large home-cooked meal that consists of many fruits, vegetables and meats to ensure that at a bare minimum I hit my protein and nutrient targets.

Since eating large meals can be very satiating the body sends responses to the brain that it can relax and recover now that food is sorted for the imminent future, you must prevent this if you are to remain alert through the day. However, utilise this satiating response at the end of the day to enhance your sleep. Enjoy a home-cooked meal with your family, now that you’re only really eating one meal a day you can make it a special one.

## Caffeine and stimulants

I believe caffeine to be a great asset in my arsenal of efficiencies, it is however with its great power comes great responsibility. What I mean is that not only is caffeine incredibly addicting, but the body neurally adapts (the central nervous system) to the stimulation and the caffeine so its use must be limited and sparse to experience the benefits.

###When I use caffeine

I do not drink caffeine usually early in the morning, my first drink on waking is a full glass of water, or two followed by a hot black or green tea. This allows the body to awaken naturally, and the slight caffeine in green tea will compliment this process. I will then have caffeine towards the middle or late morning, as this works as an appetite suppression to ensure that I do not get hungry at lunch time and can delay lunch as long as possible to benefit from the efficiency gains made in the morning when I am most effective.

###Caffeine is stolen energy

As caffeine is essentially artificial energy, you must see it as stealing energy from later in your day (Or worse, tomorrow!) and this debt must be repaid, so keep your caffeine use to the start/middle of your day and make sure you get plenty of sleep. Consuming caffeine too late in the day can end up stealing time from tomorrow, and usually in the morning where you are at your most efficient … do not do this.

##My daily routine
This routine changes dependent on what I am achieving in the day, where I am going etc, if I am training and when. However, here is an example work day where i will spend the entire day working from home in front of the computer developing. This would look very different if I was training in the day, and food would be wrapped around this.

**Waking**

Glass of water followed by tea (black or green) and a small snack if I am hungry. Usually a banana or something similar.

**Mid morning**

Coffee

**Lunch (usually as late as possible ~3pm)** 

Another opporunity to hit some protein and nutrient goals, some soup with some meat possibly, but not so much as to make me sluggish at all.

**Lunch -> evening** 

Continued tea and caffeine if really necessary following lunch (meal should not be large enough to require caffeine).

**Start of the evening** 

Small snack

**Evening** 

Large meal consisting of many vegetables and hitting and finishing off my protein goals, when these are met, I will fill remaining carb and fat calories with easy to eat foods, fruits, juice, cake … it really doesn’t matter. This makes zero difference to body composition.

##Experiment

I hope this article proves helpful as to spur thought about your own nutrition strategy. Experiment and be creative, and monitor your own energy levels and balance these carefully for incredibly potent results!
