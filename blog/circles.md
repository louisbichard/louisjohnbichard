I have previously talked about the power of keeping your own body and mind in good working order for maximal performance. One way of keeping this positive mindset in place is through the concept of the circle of concern and influence. 
This is a concept originally introduced to me in Covey's 7 habits of highly effective people.

The circle of influence and concern is where you knowingly address areas of your life that you have direct influence over, and which you do not. By doing so you can begin to free your mind of worrying about the areas of your life that you cannot control. 

For instance, when I have drawn these out for myself in the past, areas on the outside that are outside of my control are things such as: illnesses, injuries, perceptions of others etc. Whereas on the inside are the things that I can control that have influence to change these outer elements. These include: greater emphasis on mobility work, eating better quality food to prevent illness, resting well etc. You can begin to see how this creates a cause and effect connection between things in your life you cannot and can control. 

When you begin to address what you can and can't control, you will want to actively change your focus of concern to consider less of what is out of your control, and more of what is. By spending more time and physic energy on what can be changed, you will begin to leverage more of your own abilities and powers. Not only this, but you will begin to alleviate some of the negative thinking, worry and stress that may affect you.
