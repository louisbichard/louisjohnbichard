This will be a little one about habit forming and how to handle integrating new habits into your life that you have probably never done before. 

You know the ones I'm talking about, when you're feeling good and motivated, they sound like a great idea, like going out for a run in the morning. You go to bed that night super motivated, dedicated, ready to rock, maybe you even sleep in your running gear to save time and give you no excuses. When the morning comes though, and the alarm goes off, all the motivation has been slowly seeping out overnight and you're left with nothing left. 

A simple way of overcoming this is to have small, no, TINY goals, like really really, almost stupidly small goals. What do I mean by this? Okay, so to extend the running example, instead of saying "I'm going to run X miles tomorrow at 5AM" just say "I'm going to put on my running gear in the morning" or even "I'm going to run to the end of the street and back". 

One of my personal habits that I've tried to implement over was meditation, meditating each morning was the goal, and I set a goal of 10 minutes. Really, this didn't work ... if I was in a rush, or I wasn't feeling it, even 10 minutes was too large a value to try and get, and to be honest, it was just demotivating. By switching this up to become "Meditate for 30 seconds" you find yourself spending longer on it anyway, you make more time and exceed your own expectations. At this stage, it's more about consistency and habit forming then output. 

So next time you want to implement a new big habit, implement it in tiny steps.
