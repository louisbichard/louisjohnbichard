The following are 16 of my favourite productivity tools as a developer (I will add to this over time as I think of more that I use!)

_Disclaimer: Most of these are __OSX specific__, sorry windows users!_
# Web apps

#### [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/#/lists/inbox)

A neat todo app that syncs between your phone and has a real nice slick interface.

#### [Delicious](https://delicious.com/louisbichard)

A really cool bookmarking tool that is considerably better than the default folders in your browser, you can tag and retrieve bookmarks easily. Adding 'to-read' etc to these makes them even more useful to me. 

# Books

####[Flow](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Flow-Psychology-Happiness-Classic-Achieve/dp/0712657592)

About the psychology of happiness and how to get you into an effective and happy zone for working

# Chrome plugins

#### [Post man](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en)

A simple rest client resource for testing REST endpoints.

#### [Simple blocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-blocker/akfbkbiialncppkngofjpglbbobjoeoe)

A simple tool for blocking websites in your browser, makes you very effective, very fast. 

#### [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/)

Loads up your webpages on save, no more refreshing - as simple as that. 

# OSX plugins

#### [Cheat sheet](http://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/)

Adds a quick shortcut to viewing all the keyboard shortcuts in an app. 

#### [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)

Your personal OSX butler, kinda like spotlight, but really really awesome. A must.

#### [Houdini](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/houdini/id492081694?mt=12)

A tool for cleaning up applications in your MAC. Hides spare apps like extra finder windows etc keeping your desktops clutter free. 

#### [Mindful Mynah](http://www.mindfulmynah.com/)

Marketed as a 'mindfulness' tool. I actually use this for periodically reminding myself to double check to commit changes to make sure that my commits are as atomic as possible. (Get creative, you could probably use this for a whole lot more). 

#### [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/)

Click the icon to prevent your mac from going to sleep. 

#### [Little Ipsum](http://littleipsum.com/)

A basic and effective Lorem Ipsum generator

#### [Better Touch Tool](http://www.bettertouchtool.net/)

Plugin for windows like snapping to your screen, and speeding up cursors, advanced gestures and a load more

#### [Flux](https://justgetflux.com/)

Turns your monitor colour down so as to remove blue light. Keeps you from getting eye strain and helps you sleep better. 

# Sublime text plugins

#### [Zen tabs](https://github.com/travmik/ZenTabs)

Allows you to keep your tabs under value. I have it at 5. This keeps your text editor really nice and clean. 

#### [Git for sublime](https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git/wiki)

A cool tool for running git commands right in your editor, does save a lot of time and forces you to [commit atomically](http://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits/).
