In "The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People" By Stephen Covey he discusses the concept of a producer and the producing engine. Covey discusses this in terms of the story of the goose that lays golden eggs, where without the goose to produce eggs.

This is very true, and without the factory (you) work output will either be very low, or non existant. It is for this reason I bring to you a couple of methods that I like for self maintainenace, pre-habilitation (preventative measures for injury) and general health and wellbeing. These methods will help you to make sure you're always in the game, and always feeling your best. 

Self Myofasial release (SMFR) is a form of soft tissue therapy that involves therapy for mobility. I personally like this for trigger point therapy. Now I am not advising that you go out and pay for an expensive physiotherapist to stick his elbow in your back for an extortionate amount, I will instead share with you some quick ways to increase your health and wellbeing by performing some simple exercises.

There are a number of ways that you can peform self trigger point therapy. Below are just a few: 

#### The foam roller

Probably the most accessible form of SMFR. Simply look online for a foam roller, these can be aquired anywhere. Simply situate the area you want to release ontop of the roller and begin rolling in and out of the areas of tightness. To take this to the next level, consider a harder roller (or even some PVC pipe), or what is known as a 'rumble roller'.

####Â The lacrosse ball

One of the cheapest way to do this is to buy a lacross ball. With the ball you can lay on it or press it up against a wall to work through sore spots, or simply rub it on easier to reach areas such as your calves or quads. 

To really take this to the next level, you can make what is known as a peanut, this is where you take two lacross balls and tape them together. I find that using electricians tape works best, and yields a sturdy result. With this weapon of mobilistation, you can begin to work through the areas on your spine to remove pressure spots to the side of the spine. This is particularly effective on the thoracic spine (the middle of the spine). 

#### Theracane

The real daddy of SMFR in my opinion and great for trigger point therapy on your back in particular. The theracane is a shephards crook like object that using clever leverages can really help you get into some hard to reach places on your back for release. Google it to really get a better idea of the real benefits of this tool. 

#### Anything

Yes, anything can actually be used for SMFR, this includes, rolling pins, tennis balls, golf balls, anything that is the right shape for your need, whether that be spherical or rounded, there is no wrong way to do it ... so experiment. 

With this comes the concept of working 'upstream and downstream' of a problem. What this means is that if you general have issues in your shoulders, spend some time working through the neck muscles (upstream) and some time working on the arms, lats, thoracic etc downstream. It is commonly found that restriction or pain is caused by tight collections of muscle near the site of pain and not in the site itself. 

### Additional reading

Kelly Starrett's 'Becoming a supple leopard' is one of the best books I have seen around for detailing the benefits of SMFR and posture for wellbeing, it also gives fantastic indepth looks at how to perform basic maintenance upon yourself. 

### Action steps

* Spend a little time each day easing tension in your back, legs, arms or wherever using a lacrosse ball
* Experiment with items you have in your home to release tender spots
* Consider getting a theracane to drill through hard to reach mobility issues (especially in the back)
* Targeting your bottle necks and area of pain these specific points to give yourself the best possible release
