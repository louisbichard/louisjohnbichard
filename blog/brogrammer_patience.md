#The brogrammer: Patience 

It’s a pattern that I have seen throughout my entire life. A pattern that prevents the greats from really being great; patience.

Patience is a trait that the typically desk bound developer can learn from the weightlifter, yet it is not to 'have patience' that is important, it’s to know when to harness the patience you have and when to set it aside.

##Acute and chronic impatience
Let me begin by addressing that what I am not talking about is fleeting impatience. Acute/ fleeting impatience is like the impatience I suffered when writing this article (the more useful kind). I had an idea and it needed putting to paper ASAP before the moment was lost. I jumped into a nearby cafe cracked out my laptop and got to work. Fleeting impatience is the type of impatience that disappears almost as soon as it appears, it is acute and momentary. Chronic impatience however is the real killer, and will be the subject of this article.

##Impatience in weightlifting

Let me digress for a moment.

"Weightlifting is a patient sport making the weightlifter a patient (or stubborn) person."

Attempting PB’s everyday
“A good athlete (and a good developer!) must auto regulate his own energy.”
Everyday isn’t about writing more code than you did yesterday, or lifting more weight. Let me explain.

I often see the type of weightlifters in the gym attempting personal best’s day in, day out; throwing themselves under a bar time after time with weight they cannot lift, impatience of the acute and chronic variety infests the athlete however interestingly these types are often also the best coaches.

This energy is well intentioned but is sub-optimal. The lifter that takes the time to see where he is weak, and spend session after session nailing a movement pattern will be the one to succeed in the long run.

Take time away from the core problem, improve the periphery and the problem will be much more scalable.

##A PB is always good, right?
Do not, whatever you do, hit what i call a ‘dirty PB’. A dirty PB is one where you get so psyched up, so amped that you summon super pysiological levels of strength through overloading your nervours system and just going for broke, leaving nothing in the tank, sacrificing form, technique in favour of raw brutish strength. This is extremely detrimental physically, but more important: mentally.

You made a 600lb squat? a 315 snatch? you commited 75 times in a day? Closed 20 issues? So what?

Will you be able to recreate it tomorrow? Next week? In a month?

Maybe, maybe not, you’re leaving it to chance, the stars aligned in your favour this time, but you’ll be waiting a long time for them to align again. Soon you find yourself trying to recreate (and beat!) a situation largely built from chance. Chance isn’t reproducible, and how do you build on chance?

Short answer: You don’t.

Any successes you make should be built on repeatable methods where you truly understand the makings of the success so that you can employ the same method in future time and time again.

##The necessity of impatience
Sometimes acute impatience is necessary. A weightlifter cannot afford to be patient when the time comes to make the an important lift, they must not think about it, instead they must let their instinct take over and trust in their intuition. When you need to get a product to market, sometimes you need to be fast, and you need to cut corners, you must however understand that this is not sustainable in the long term, and this behaviour should be shut down as soon as possible or suffer the pain of the house built on poor foundations.

##House built on poor foundations

You have a house made of suboptimal bricks, they rot and decay frequently and you’re constantly having to buy new bricks to replace them. You decide you want to build an extension and get some workmen in. But unfortunately when they leave you’re left juggling a house made out of poor bricks with no time to in your extension with your feet up reading the paper, you’re too busy running around tending to the bricks.

Finish what you’ve started before you move on. How can you build new features on poor architecture? Take the time not just to plan out your architecture, but to maintain it, wonder fixing bugs before writing code is a part of the Joel test.

“No amount of coaching cue’s will work if you simply do not have the strength” — Dmitry Klokov

I love this quote from Klokov, no matter your knowledge in patching a problem, if your core, your foundation is not strong enough, you will never achieve true greatness.

I hope this serves as a reminder to find the time to systematically take a step back and make sure you’re finishing what you start. A lack of investment in yourself (or your company, product or project) isn’t sustainable. It hurts the ego, but you must tame the need to satisfy the ego and use the patience you have if you truly wish to succeed.
