#Javascript unit test spies explained

Below is a quick introduction and explanation of what test spies are using an example from the Jasmine test library and how you can use them in your own code.

##What is a spy?
A spy is essentially a function that wraps another function, so that instead of calling the original, the new wrapped function is called.

##Why do I need a spy?
A spy therefore allows you to know when, how often and with what parameters a function is called without calling the function itself. This is really useful as in pretty much all cases, you donâ€™t actually want to call the other function, just know that it has been called.

##How to spy?
To take the example from the Jasmine website.

	// Here the object is passed as the first parameter. With the objects property (that is the reference to a function) is passed in second. Now when the foo.setBar() function is called, Jasmine knows how many times and with what parameters the function has been called with. 
	spyOn(foo, 'setBar');

	// Now the function is called, but remember it is the jasmine wrapped function, not the original that is called here.
	foo.setBar(123);

	// Lastly you can use the test to make sure that the function has been called when expected, or that it hasn't been called if not expected. 
	expect(foo.setBar).toHaveBeenCalled();
