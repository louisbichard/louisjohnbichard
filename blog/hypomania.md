__Disclaimer:__ Before I begin this article I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not trivialising Hypomania as a mental condition, I am using the term to refer to the indescribable euphoric high of exercise and its abilities whens harnessed as a creativity tool. 

#### Okay, so why am I using the term hypomania and what does it mean? 

Hypomaniacs experience periods of heightened euphoria and commonly describe feelings of immense creativity and enthusiasm during these 'highs'. However, sufferers of hypomania also experience 'crashes', every high has to come with its consequence. 

#### Exercise-induced hypomania

However there is what is known as drug induced hypomania, which can be caused by certain drugs. I have personally however experienced and continue to experience hypomaniac like conditions from intense training. Following training sessions I will get several hours of pure, raw energy that I use to hone for the most creative of tasks that I need to do that day.

This hypomaniac like euphoria is extremely useful. I have sometimes trained in the mornings to utilise this as I begin work. The training doesn't even have to be that much. Get up in the morning, have a glass of water, meditate and then spend 20 minutes of high intensity sprints/ pushups etc. It doesn't really matter, aslong as it's intense enough to release an endorphin rush to _alert and awaken_ the body for the day. This could even be done by cycling or running to work, however I would say that rather than cycling in your work clothes, put on some serious training gear, and challenge yourself to do fartlek sprints between traffic lights etc. 

(Fartlek is a swedish term that blends continuous training with interval work)

This investment in training for just 20 minutes a day can _drastically_ increase your production throughout the day. If you are lucky enough to have a break in the middle of your day, I would say that this is absolutely perfect and you should use utilise this if possible for some high intensity exercise. 

#### Action items: 

* Orientate your day to incorporate this short burst (or more) of intense exercise to really increase your. 
* Consider cycling or running to work
